This project is a simple recipe collection application created to demonstrate proficiency in Git and version control. The application organizes recipes into three categories: Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. 
Each recipe is stored in a markdown file with ingredients and instructions for easy reference.
The primary purpose of this project is to practice Git skills, including branch management, merging, conflict resolution, and interactive rebasing, to simulate a real-world collaborative environment.
